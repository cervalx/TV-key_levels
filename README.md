3. Create new script by opening template new indicator
4. Copy the contents of the script for the desired date into the window

- The script does not update automatically and must be manually copied every day.

In order to process the post lines I use two tools:
1. https://capitalizemytitle.com/tools/column-to-comma-separated-list/
With the following settings

That generates a string array example:
```python
'5695-5700 - key level. Strong. It is becoming more magnetic, we see as open interest here increases. can see it achieved soon.;5675;5667 - quants max. I think there is risk of this breaking today, so size smaller, but letâ€™s see. ;5650;5640;5625;5615 - stronger supp;5609;5596-5600 - quants min;5590 ;5581;5570-5575'
```
3. I process the array using a custom Python script in a online Jupyter notebook (on (https://colab.research.google.com): Tear_Levels.ipynb
